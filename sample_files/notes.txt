Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence.

Examples of AI applications include:

1. Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa
2. Recommendation systems used by YouTube and Netflix
3. Self-driving cars
4. Chatbots and virtual assistants
5. Image and face recognition systems

AI works using techniques such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing.

Machine Learning allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

Deep Learning uses neural networks to solve complex problems such as image recognition and language translation.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps computers understand and communicate in human language.

AI is used in many industries including healthcare, education, finance, and transportation.

In the future, AI will continue to improve automation, increase efficiency, and create new technologies that benefit society.
